1	HOLT	Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.	N/A	-	-
2	HOLT	I'm Lester Holt, anchor of "NBC Nightly News."	N/A	-	-
3	HOLT	I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.	N/A	-	-
4	HOLT	The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.	N/A	-	-
5	HOLT	This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization.	N/A	-	-
6	HOLT	The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.	N/A	-	-
7	HOLT	The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long.	N/A	-	-
8	HOLT	We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.	N/A	-	-
9	HOLT	At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.	N/A	-	-
10	HOLT	From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.	N/A	-	-
11	HOLT	The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.	N/A	-	-
12	HOLT	The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.	N/A	-	-
13	HOLT	I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.	N/A	-	-
14	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
15	CLINTON	How are you, Donald?	N/A	-	-
16	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
17	HOLT	Good luck to you.	N/A	-	-
18	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
19	HOLT	Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.	N/A	-	-
20	HOLT	We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.	N/A	-	-
21	HOLT	I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.	N/A	-	-
22	HOLT	Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.	N/A	-	-
23	HOLT	So, let's begin.	N/A	-	-
24	HOLT	We're calling this opening segment "Achieving Prosperity."	N/A	-	-
25	HOLT	And central to that is jobs.	N/A	-	-
26	HOLT	There are two economic realities in America today.	N/A	-	-
27	HOLT	There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.	N/A	-	-
28	HOLT	However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.	N/A	-	-
29	HOLT	Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?	N/A	-	-
30	CLINTON	Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.	N/A	-	-
31	CLINTON	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	N/A	-	-
32	CLINTON	Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.	N/A	-	-
33	CLINTON	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	N/A	-	-
34	CLINTON	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	N/A	-	-
35	CLINTON	I want us to invest in you.	N/A	-	-
36	CLINTON	I want us to invest in your future.	N/A	-	-
37	CLINTON	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	N/A	-	-
38	CLINTON	We also have to make the economy fairer.	N/A	-	-
39	CLINTON	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	N/A	-	-
40	CLINTON	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.	N/A	-	-
41	CLINTON	If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.	N/A	-	-
42	CLINTON	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	N/A	-	-
43	CLINTON	I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.	N/A	-	-
44	CLINTON	So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.	N/A	-	-
45	CLINTON	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	N/A	-	-
46	CLINTON	How are we going to do it?	N/A	-	-
47	CLINTON	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.	N/A	-	-
48	CLINTON	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	N/A	-	-
49	CLINTON	We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.	N/A	-	-
50	CLINTON	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	N/A	-	-
51	CLINTON	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	N/A	-	-
52	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, thank you.	N/A	-	-
53	HOLT	Mr. Trump, the same question to you.	N/A	-	-
54	HOLT	It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.	N/A	-	-
55	HOLT	You have up to two minutes.	N/A	-	-
56	TRUMP	Thank you, Lester.	N/A	-	-
57	TRUMP	Our jobs are fleeing the country.	N/A	-	-
58	TRUMP	They're going to Mexico.	N/A	-	-
59	TRUMP	They're going to many other countries.	N/A	-	-
60	TRUMP	You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.	N/A	-	-
61	TRUMP	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	N/A	-	-
62	TRUMP	And we have a very good fight.	N/A	-	-
63	TRUMP	And we have a winning fight.	N/A	-	-
64	TRUMP	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.	N/A	-	-
65	TRUMP	So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.	N/A	-	-
66	TRUMP	When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.	N/A	-	-
67	TRUMP	They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.	N/A	-	-
68	TRUMP	With the United States, as he said, not so much.	N/A	-	-
69	TRUMP	So Ford is leaving.	1	Ford Motor Company is moving their small car division out of the USA.	TRUE
70	TRUMP	You see that, their small car division leaving.	1	Ford Motor Company is moving their small car division out of the USA.	TRUE
71	TRUMP	Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.	2	Thousands of jobs are being lost in Michigan and Ohio due to Ford Motor Company moving their small car division out of the USA.	FALSE
72	TRUMP	They're all leaving.	N/A	-	-
73	TRUMP	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	N/A	-	-
74	TRUMP	As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.	N/A	-	-
75	TRUMP	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	N/A	-	-
76	TRUMP	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	N/A	-	-
77	TRUMP	We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.	N/A	-	-
78	TRUMP	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	N/A	-	-
79	TRUMP	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	N/A	-	-
80	TRUMP	They're going to Mexico.	N/A	-	-
81	TRUMP	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	N/A	-	-
82	TRUMP	We cannot let it happen.	N/A	-	-
83	TRUMP	Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.	N/A	-	-
84	TRUMP	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	N/A	-	-
85	TRUMP	It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.	N/A	-	-
86	TRUMP	Companies will come.	N/A	-	-
87	TRUMP	They will build.	N/A	-	-
88	TRUMP	They will expand.	N/A	-	-
89	TRUMP	New companies will start.	N/A	-	-
90	TRUMP	And I look very, very much forward to doing it.	N/A	-	-
91	TRUMP	We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.	N/A	-	-
92	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?	N/A	-	-
93	CLINTON	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	N/A	-	-
94	CLINTON	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	N/A	-	-
95	CLINTON	And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.	N/A	-	-
96	CLINTON	We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.	N/A	-	-
97	CLINTON	And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.	N/A	-	-
98	CLINTON	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	N/A	-	-
99	CLINTON	I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.	N/A	-	-
100	CLINTON	That is not how we grow the economy.	N/A	-	-
101	CLINTON	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	N/A	-	-
102	CLINTON	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.	N/A	-	-
103	CLINTON	I understand that.	N/A	-	-
104	CLINTON	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	N/A	-	-
105	CLINTON	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	3	Donald Trump started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father.	TRUE
106	CLINTON	I don't buy that.	N/A	-	-
107	CLINTON	I have a different experience.	N/A	-	-
108	CLINTON	My father was a small-businessman.	N/A	-	-
109	CLINTON	He worked really hard.	N/A	-	-
110	CLINTON	He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.	N/A	-	-
111	CLINTON	And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.	N/A	-	-
112	CLINTON	That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.	N/A	-	-
113	HOLT	Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.	N/A	-	-
114	HOLT	You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.	N/A	-	-
115	HOLT	How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?	N/A	-	-
116	HOLT	How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?	N/A	-	-
117	TRUMP	Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	4	Donald Trump's father gave Donald Trump a very small loan in 1975, and Donald Trump built it into a company that’s worth billions of dollars.	HALF-TRUE
118	TRUMP	Our country's in deep trouble.	N/A	-	-
119	TRUMP	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	N/A	-	-
120	TRUMP	They're the best, the best ever at it.	N/A	-	-
121	TRUMP	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	N/A	-	-
122	TRUMP	So we have to do that.	N/A	-	-
123	TRUMP	We have to renegotiate our trade deals.	N/A	-	-
124	TRUMP	And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.	N/A	-	-
125	TRUMP	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	N/A	-	-
126	TRUMP	They have a VAT tax.	N/A	-	-
127	TRUMP	We're on a different system.	N/A	-	-
128	TRUMP	When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.	N/A	-	-
129	TRUMP	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	N/A	-	-
130	TRUMP	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	N/A	-	-
131	TRUMP	It's a defective agreement.	N/A	-	-
132	TRUMP	It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.	N/A	-	-
133	TRUMP	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	N/A	-	-
134	TRUMP	Good.	N/A	-	-
135	TRUMP	I want you to be very happy.	N/A	-	-
136	TRUMP	It's very important to me.	N/A	-	-
137	TRUMP	But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.	N/A	-	-
138	TRUMP	She's been doing this for 30 years.	N/A	-	-
139	TRUMP	And why hasn't she made the agreements better?	N/A	-	-
140	TRUMP	The NAFTA agreement is defective.	N/A	-	-
141	TRUMP	Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...	N/A	-	-
142	HOLT	Let me interrupt just a moment, but...	N/A	-	-
143	TRUMP	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	N/A	-	-
144	TRUMP	They should have been doing this for years.	N/A	-	-
145	TRUMP	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	N/A	-	-
146	TRUMP	We cannot do it any longer, Lester.	N/A	-	-
147	HOLT	Back to the question, though.	N/A	-	-
148	HOLT	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	N/A	-	-
149	HOLT	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	N/A	-	-
150	TRUMP	Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.	N/A	-	-
151	TRUMP	The companies are leaving.	N/A	-	-
152	TRUMP	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	N/A	-	-
153	TRUMP	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	N/A	-	-
154	TRUMP	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	N/A	-	-
155	TRUMP	We wish you a lot of luck.	N/A	-	-
156	TRUMP	But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.	N/A	-	-
157	TRUMP	And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.	N/A	-	-
158	TRUMP	So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.	N/A	-	-
159	TRUMP	We have to stop them from leaving.	N/A	-	-
160	TRUMP	And that's a big, big factor.	N/A	-	-
161	HOLT	Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.	N/A	-	-
162	CLINTON	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	N/A	-	-
163	CLINTON	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	N/A	-	-
164	CLINTON	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	N/A	-	-
165	CLINTON	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	N/A	-	-
166	CLINTON	He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."	N/A	-	-
167	CLINTON	Well, it did collapse.	N/A	-	-
168	TRUMP	That's called business, by the way.	N/A	-	-
169	CLINTON	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	N/A	-	-
170	CLINTON	Five million people lost their homes.	N/A	-	-
171	CLINTON	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	N/A	-	-
172	CLINTON	Now, we have come back from that abyss.	N/A	-	-
173	CLINTON	And it has not been easy.	N/A	-	-
174	CLINTON	So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.	N/A	-	-
175	CLINTON	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	5	Independent experts have said that Donald Trump's tax plan would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion, that it would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, that it would cause the USA to lose 3.5 million jobs and might cause another recession.	HALF-TRUE
176	CLINTON	They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.	6	Independent experts believe that Hillary Clinton's plans would create 10 million more new jobs in the USA.	HALF-TRUE
177	CLINTON	Take clean energy.	N/A	-	-
178	CLINTON	Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.	N/A	-	-
179	CLINTON	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	7	Donald Trump has said that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	HALF-TRUE
180	CLINTON	I think it's real.	N/A	-	-
181	TRUMP	I did not.	N/A	-	-
182	TRUMP	I did not.	N/A	-	-
183	TRUMP	I do not say that.	N/A	-	-
184	CLINTON	I think science is real.	N/A	-	-
185	TRUMP	I do not say that.	N/A	-	-
186	CLINTON	And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.	N/A	-	-
187	CLINTON	And here's what we can do.	N/A	-	-
188	CLINTON	We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.	N/A	-	-
189	CLINTON	We can have enough clean energy to power every home.	N/A	-	-
190	CLINTON	We can build a new modern electric grid.	N/A	-	-
191	CLINTON	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.	N/A	-	-
192	CLINTON	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	N/A	-	-
193	HOLT	Mr. Trump?	N/A	-	-
194	TRUMP	She talks about solar panels.	N/A	-	-
195	TRUMP	We invested in a solar company, our country.	N/A	-	-
196	TRUMP	That was a disaster.	N/A	-	-
197	TRUMP	They lost plenty of money on that one.	N/A	-	-
198	TRUMP	Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.	N/A	-	-
199	TRUMP	Our energy policies are a disaster.	N/A	-	-
200	TRUMP	Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.	N/A	-	-
201	TRUMP	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	N/A	-	-
202	TRUMP	The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.	N/A	-	-
203	TRUMP	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	N/A	-	-
204	TRUMP	So I will tell you this.	N/A	-	-
205	TRUMP	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	N/A	-	-
206	TRUMP	And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.	N/A	-	-
207	TRUMP	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	N/A	-	-
208	TRUMP	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	N/A	-	-
209	TRUMP	You've been doing this for 30 years.	N/A	-	-
210	TRUMP	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?	N/A	-	-
211	TRUMP	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	N/A	-	-
212	CLINTON	Well, actually...	N/A	-	-
213	TRUMP	I will bring -- excuse me.	N/A	-	-
214	TRUMP	I will bring back jobs.	N/A	-	-
215	TRUMP	You can't bring back jobs.	N/A	-	-
216	CLINTON	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	N/A	-	-
217	TRUMP	Yeah, for 30 years.	N/A	-	-
218	CLINTON	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	N/A	-	-
219	CLINTON	I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.	N/A	-	-
220	CLINTON	I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...	N/A	-	-
221	TRUMP	Well, he approved NAFTA...	8	President Bill Clinton approved NAFTA.	HALF-TRUE
222	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
223	CLINTON	million new jobs, a balanced budget...	N/A	-	-
224	TRUMP	He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.	8	President Bill Clinton approved NAFTA.	HALF-TRUE
225	CLINTON	Incomes went up for everybody.	N/A	-	-
226	CLINTON	Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.	N/A	-	-
227	CLINTON	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	N/A	-	-
228	CLINTON	Will they create jobs in America?	N/A	-	-
229	CLINTON	Will they raise incomes in America?	N/A	-	-
230	CLINTON	And are they good for our national security?	N/A	-	-
231	CLINTON	Some of them I voted for.	N/A	-	-
232	CLINTON	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	N/A	-	-
233	CLINTON	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	N/A	-	-
234	CLINTON	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	N/A	-	-
235	CLINTON	I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.	N/A	-	-
236	CLINTON	I'm going to have a special prosecutor.	N/A	-	-
237	CLINTON	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	N/A	-	-
238	CLINTON	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	N/A	-	-
239	CLINTON	We increased them to China 50 percent.	N/A	-	-
240	CLINTON	So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.	N/A	-	-
241	HOLT	Very quickly...	N/A	-	-
242	TRUMP	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	N/A	-	-
243	CLINTON	Well, I've been a senator, Donald...	N/A	-	-
244	TRUMP	You haven't done it.	N/A	-	-
245	TRUMP	You haven't done it.	N/A	-	-
246	CLINTON	And I have been a secretary of state...	N/A	-	-
247	TRUMP	Excuse me.	N/A	-	-
248	CLINTON	And I have done a lot...	N/A	-	-
249	TRUMP	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	9	NAFTA is one of the worst things that ever happened to the US manufacturing industry.	FALSE
250	CLINTON	Well, that's your opinion.	N/A	-	-
251	CLINTON	That is your opinion.	N/A	-	-
252	TRUMP	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	N/A	-	-
253	TRUMP	NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.	N/A	-	-
254	TRUMP	And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.	N/A	-	-
255	TRUMP	You were totally in favor of it.	N/A	-	-
256	TRUMP	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	N/A	-	-
257	TRUMP	But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.	N/A	-	-
258	TRUMP	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	N/A	-	-
259	CLINTON	Well, that is just not accurate.	N/A	-	-
260	CLINTON	I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.	N/A	-	-
261	CLINTON	I wrote about that in...	N/A	-	-
262	TRUMP	You called it the gold standard.	10	Hillary Clinton has called NAFTA the gold standard of trade deals.	TRUE
263	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
264	TRUMP	You called it the gold standard of trade deals.	10	Hillary Clinton has called NAFTA the gold standard of trade deals.	TRUE
265	TRUMP	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.	10	Hillary Clinton has called NAFTA the gold standard of trade deals.	TRUE
266	CLINTON	No.	N/A	-	-
267	TRUMP	And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.	N/A	-	-
268	CLINTON	Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.	N/A	-	-
269	CLINTON	The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...	N/A	-	-
270	TRUMP	Not.	N/A	-	-
271	CLINTON	which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.	N/A	-	-
272	CLINTON	I wrote about that in my book...	N/A	-	-
273	TRUMP	So is it President Obama's fault?	N/A	-	-
274	CLINTON	before you even announced.	N/A	-	-
275	TRUMP	Is it President Obama's fault?	N/A	-	-
276	CLINTON	Look, there are differences...	N/A	-	-
277	TRUMP	Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?	N/A	-	-
278	CLINTON	There are...	N/A	-	-
279	TRUMP	Because he's pushing it.	N/A	-	-
280	CLINTON	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	N/A	-	-
281	CLINTON	And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.	N/A	-	-
282	CLINTON	That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.	N/A	-	-
283	TRUMP	But you have no plan.	N/A	-	-
284	CLINTON	But in -- oh, but I do.	N/A	-	-
285	TRUMP	Secretary, you have no plan.	N/A	-	-
286	CLINTON	In fact, I have written a book about it.	N/A	-	-
287	CLINTON	It's called "Stronger Together."	N/A	-	-
288	CLINTON	You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...	N/A	-	-
289	TRUMP	That's about all you've...	N/A	-	-
290	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
291	HOLT	Folks, we're going to...	N/A	-	-
292	CLINTON	or at an airport near you.	N/A	-	-
293	HOLT	We're going to move to...	N/A	-	-
294	CLINTON	But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.	N/A	-	-
295	CLINTON	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	N/A	-	-
296	CLINTON	So we have a very robust set of plans.	N/A	-	-
297	CLINTON	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	N/A	-	-
298	TRUMP	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.	N/A	-	-
299	TRUMP	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.	N/A	-	-
300	TRUMP	You are going to drive business out.	N/A	-	-
301	TRUMP	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	N/A	-	-
302	TRUMP	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	N/A	-	-
303	TRUMP	I'm very proud of it.	N/A	-	-
304	TRUMP	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	N/A	-	-
305	TRUMP	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	N/A	-	-
306	TRUMP	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	N/A	-	-
307	TRUMP	And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.	N/A	-	-
308	TRUMP	You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.	N/A	-	-
309	TRUMP	And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.	N/A	-	-
310	TRUMP	I'm going to cut regulations.	N/A	-	-
311	TRUMP	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	N/A	-	-
312	HOLT	Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment.	N/A	-	-
313	HOLT	We're going to talk taxes...	N/A	-	-
314	CLINTON	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	N/A	-	-
315	HOLT	Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.	N/A	-	-
316	CLINTON	I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...	N/A	-	-
317	TRUMP	Facts.	N/A	-	-
318	CLINTON	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	N/A	-	-
319	CLINTON	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	N/A	-	-
320	CLINTON	Because what I have proposed...	N/A	-	-
321	TRUMP	And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.	N/A	-	-
322	CLINTON	would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	N/A	-	-
323	CLINTON	What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.	N/A	-	-
324	CLINTON	What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.	N/A	-	-
325	CLINTON	And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.	N/A	-	-
326	HOLT	Well, you just opened the next segment.	N/A	-	-
327	TRUMP	Well, could I just finish -- I think I...	N/A	-	-
328	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
329	HOLT	I'm going to give you a chance right here...	N/A	-	-
330	TRUMP	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	N/A	-	-
331	HOLT	with a new 15-minute segment...	N/A	-	-
332	TRUMP	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.	N/A	-	-
333	HOLT	Mr. Trump, I'm going to...	N/A	-	-
334	TRUMP	And look at her website.	N/A	-	-
335	TRUMP	You know what?	N/A	-	-
336	TRUMP	It's no difference than this.	N/A	-	-
337	TRUMP	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	N/A	-	-
338	TRUMP	Just go to her website.	N/A	-	-
339	TRUMP	She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.	N/A	-	-
340	TRUMP	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	N/A	-	-
341	HOLT	The next segment, we're continuing...	N/A	-	-
342	CLINTON	Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.	N/A	-	-
343	HOLT	achieving prosperity...	N/A	-	-
344	TRUMP	No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	N/A	-	-
345	CLINTON	No, we're not.	N/A	-	-
346	CLINTON	No, we're not.	N/A	-	-
347	TRUMP	See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	N/A	-	-
348	TRUMP	No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.	N/A	-	-
349	CLINTON	That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.	N/A	-	-
350	HOLT	OK, you are unpacking a lot here.	N/A	-	-
351	HOLT	And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.	N/A	-	-
352	HOLT	And I want to talk about taxes.	N/A	-	-
353	HOLT	The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.	N/A	-	-
354	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.	N/A	-	-
355	HOLT	I'd like you to further defend that.	N/A	-	-
356	HOLT	And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.	N/A	-	-
357	HOLT	I'd like you to defend that.	N/A	-	-
358	HOLT	And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.	N/A	-	-
359	TRUMP	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	N/A	-	-
360	TRUMP	They're going to expand their companies.	N/A	-	-
361	TRUMP	They're going to do a tremendous job.	N/A	-	-
362	TRUMP	I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.	N/A	-	-
363	TRUMP	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	N/A	-	-
364	TRUMP	It's a great thing for the middle class.	N/A	-	-
365	TRUMP	It's a great thing for companies to expand.	N/A	-	-
366	TRUMP	And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.	N/A	-	-
367	TRUMP	So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.	N/A	-	-
368	TRUMP	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	N/A	-	-
369	TRUMP	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	N/A	-	-
370	TRUMP	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	N/A	-	-
371	TRUMP	And here's the thing.	N/A	-	-
372	TRUMP	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	N/A	-	-
373	TRUMP	I happen to think it's double that.	N/A	-	-
374	TRUMP	It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.	N/A	-	-
375	TRUMP	And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.	N/A	-	-
376	TRUMP	But we have no leadership.	N/A	-	-
377	TRUMP	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	N/A	-	-
378	HOLT	All right.	N/A	-	-
379	HOLT	You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.	N/A	-	-
380	CLINTON	I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.	N/A	-	-
381	TRUMP	Why not?	N/A	-	-
382	CLINTON	Why not?	N/A	-	-
383	CLINTON	Yeah, why not?	N/A	-	-
384	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	N/A	-	-
385	CLINTON	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	N/A	-	-
386	CLINTON	Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...	N/A	-	-
387	TRUMP	There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.	N/A	-	-
388	HOLT	This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.	N/A	-	-
389	TRUMP	Yes.	N/A	-	-
390	CLINTON	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	N/A	-	-
391	CLINTON	We've looked at your tax proposals.	N/A	-	-
392	CLINTON	I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.	N/A	-	-
393	CLINTON	I happen to support that.	N/A	-	-
394	TRUMP	Then you didn't read it.	N/A	-	-
395	CLINTON	I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.	N/A	-	-
396	CLINTON	But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.	N/A	-	-
397	CLINTON	You've proposed an approach that has a...	N/A	-	-
398	TRUMP	Who gave it that name?	N/A	-	-
399	TRUMP	The first I've -- who gave it that name?	N/A	-	-
400	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
401	HOLT	Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.	N/A	-	-
402	CLINTON	$4 billion tax benefit for your family.	N/A	-	-
403	CLINTON	And when you look at what you are proposing...	N/A	-	-
404	TRUMP	How much?	N/A	-	-
405	TRUMP	How much for my family?	N/A	-	-
406	CLINTON	it is...	N/A	-	-
407	TRUMP	Lester, how much?	N/A	-	-
408	CLINTON	as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	N/A	-	-
409	CLINTON	Trickle-down did not work.	N/A	-	-
410	CLINTON	It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.	N/A	-	-
411	CLINTON	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	N/A	-	-
412	CLINTON	And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.	N/A	-	-
413	CLINTON	And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.	N/A	-	-
414	CLINTON	I don't think top-down works in America.	N/A	-	-
415	CLINTON	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	N/A	-	-
416	CLINTON	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	N/A	-	-
417	CLINTON	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	N/A	-	-
418	HOLT	Mr. Trump, we're...	N/A	-	-
419	TRUMP	Typical politician.	N/A	-	-
420	TRUMP	All talk, no action.	N/A	-	-
421	TRUMP	Sounds good, doesn't work.	N/A	-	-
422	TRUMP	Never going to happen.	N/A	-	-
423	TRUMP	Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.	N/A	-	-
424	TRUMP	Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.	N/A	-	-
425	TRUMP	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	N/A	-	-
426	TRUMP	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	N/A	-	-
427	TRUMP	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	N/A	-	-
428	TRUMP	And we better be awfully careful.	N/A	-	-
429	TRUMP	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	N/A	-	-
430	TRUMP	This Janet Yellen of the Fed.	N/A	-	-
431	TRUMP	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	N/A	-	-
432	TRUMP	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	N/A	-	-
433	TRUMP	The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.	N/A	-	-
434	HOLT	Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.	N/A	-	-
435	HOLT	And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.	N/A	-	-
436	HOLT	Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?	N/A	-	-
437	TRUMP	I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.	N/A	-	-
438	TRUMP	And it'll be released.	N/A	-	-
439	TRUMP	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	N/A	-	-
440	TRUMP	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	N/A	-	-
441	TRUMP	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	N/A	-	-
442	TRUMP	If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.	N/A	-	-
443	TRUMP	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	N/A	-	-
444	TRUMP	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	11	In 2015, USA had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion a year.	HALF-TRUE
445	TRUMP	You know what that is?	N/A	-	-
446	TRUMP	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	N/A	-	-
447	TRUMP	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	N/A	-	-
448	HOLT	The IRS says an audit...	N/A	-	-
449	TRUMP	Excuse me.	N/A	-	-
450	HOLT	of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.	N/A	-	-
451	HOLT	And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...	N/A	-	-
452	TRUMP	Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.	N/A	-	-
453	TRUMP	Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.	N/A	-	-
454	TRUMP	I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.	N/A	-	-
455	TRUMP	I said, do you get audited?	N/A	-	-
456	TRUMP	I get audited almost every year.	N/A	-	-
457	TRUMP	And in a way, I should be complaining.	N/A	-	-
458	TRUMP	I'm not even complaining.	N/A	-	-
459	TRUMP	I don't mind it.	N/A	-	-
460	TRUMP	It's almost become a way of life.	N/A	-	-
461	TRUMP	I get audited by the IRS.	N/A	-	-
462	TRUMP	But other people don't.	N/A	-	-
463	TRUMP	I will say this.	N/A	-	-
464	TRUMP	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	N/A	-	-
465	TRUMP	I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.	N/A	-	-
466	TRUMP	As soon as she releases them, I will release.	N/A	-	-
467	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
468	TRUMP	I will release my tax returns.	N/A	-	-
469	TRUMP	And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, "Don't do it."	N/A	-	-
470	TRUMP	I will tell you this.	N/A	-	-
471	TRUMP	No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.	N/A	-	-
472	TRUMP	Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.	N/A	-	-
473	TRUMP	When the audit's complete, I'll do it.	N/A	-	-
474	TRUMP	But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.	N/A	-	-
475	HOLT	So it's negotiable?	N/A	-	-
476	TRUMP	It's not negotiable, no.	N/A	-	-
477	TRUMP	Let her release the e-mails.	N/A	-	-
478	TRUMP	Why did she delete 33,000...	N/A	-	-
479	HOLT	Well, I'll let her answer that.	N/A	-	-
480	HOLT	But let me just admonish the audience one more time.	N/A	-	-
481	HOLT	There was an agreement.	N/A	-	-
482	HOLT	We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.	N/A	-	-
483	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	N/A	-	-
484	CLINTON	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	N/A	-	-
485	CLINTON	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	N/A	-	-
486	CLINTON	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	N/A	-	-
487	CLINTON	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	N/A	-	-
488	CLINTON	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	N/A	-	-
489	CLINTON	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	N/A	-	-
490	CLINTON	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	N/A	-	-
491	CLINTON	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	N/A	-	-
492	CLINTON	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	N/A	-	-
493	CLINTON	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	12	Donald Trump did not pay any federal income tax between 1975 and 1979.	FALSE
494	TRUMP	That makes me smart.	N/A	-	-
495	CLINTON	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	N/A	-	-
496	CLINTON	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	N/A	-	-
497	CLINTON	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	N/A	-	-
498	CLINTON	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	N/A	-	-
499	CLINTON	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.	N/A	-	-
500	CLINTON	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	N/A	-	-
501	CLINTON	And we'll guess.	N/A	-	-
502	CLINTON	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	N/A	-	-
503	CLINTON	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	N/A	-	-
504	CLINTON	Who does he owe money to?	N/A	-	-
505	CLINTON	Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.	N/A	-	-
506	HOLT	He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.	N/A	-	-
507	HOLT	Do you want to respond to that?	N/A	-	-
508	CLINTON	I do.	N/A	-	-
509	CLINTON	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	N/A	-	-
510	TRUMP	That's for sure.	N/A	-	-
511	CLINTON	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	N/A	-	-
512	CLINTON	But I'm not going to make any excuses.	N/A	-	-
513	CLINTON	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	N/A	-	-
514	HOLT	Mr. Trump?	N/A	-	-
515	TRUMP	That was more than a mistake.	N/A	-	-
516	TRUMP	That was done purposely.	N/A	-	-
517	TRUMP	OK?	N/A	-	-
518	TRUMP	That was not a mistake.	N/A	-	-
519	TRUMP	That was done purposely.	N/A	-	-
520	TRUMP	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.	N/A	-	-
521	TRUMP	And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.	N/A	-	-
522	TRUMP	As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.	13	There is not much useful information in tax returns.	FALSE
523	TRUMP	That I can tell you.	N/A	-	-
524	TRUMP	You learn a lot from financial disclosure.	N/A	-	-
525	TRUMP	And you should go down and take a look at that.	N/A	-	-
526	TRUMP	The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.	N/A	-	-
527	TRUMP	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	N/A	-	-
528	TRUMP	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	N/A	-	-
529	TRUMP	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	N/A	-	-
530	TRUMP	And the $650 isn't even on that.	N/A	-	-
531	TRUMP	But it's not $650.	N/A	-	-
532	TRUMP	It's much less than that.	N/A	-	-
533	TRUMP	But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.	N/A	-	-
534	TRUMP	These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.	N/A	-	-
535	TRUMP	I could do that very quickly.	N/A	-	-
536	TRUMP	I am very underleveraged.	N/A	-	-
537	TRUMP	I have a great company.	N/A	-	-
538	TRUMP	I have a tremendous income.	N/A	-	-
539	TRUMP	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	N/A	-	-
540	TRUMP	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	N/A	-	-
541	TRUMP	When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.	N/A	-	-
542	TRUMP	Our airports are like from a third world country.	N/A	-	-
543	TRUMP	You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.	N/A	-	-
544	TRUMP	So the worst of all things has happened.	N/A	-	-
545	TRUMP	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	N/A	-	-
546	TRUMP	We haven't even started.	N/A	-	-
547	TRUMP	And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.	N/A	-	-
548	TRUMP	Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.	N/A	-	-
549	TRUMP	And it's really a shame.	N/A	-	-
550	TRUMP	And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.	N/A	-	-
551	TRUMP	Our country has tremendous problems.	N/A	-	-
552	TRUMP	We're a debtor nation.	N/A	-	-
553	TRUMP	We're a serious debtor nation.	N/A	-	-
554	TRUMP	And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.	N/A	-	-
555	TRUMP	And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.	N/A	-	-
556	HOLT	We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.	N/A	-	-
557	CLINTON	And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.	N/A	-	-
558	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
559	CLINTON	And the other thing I think is important...	N/A	-	-
560	TRUMP	It would be squandered, too, believe me.	N/A	-	-
561	CLINTON	is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.	N/A	-	-
562	CLINTON	You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.	N/A	-	-
563	CLINTON	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	N/A	-	-
564	CLINTON	I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.	N/A	-	-
565	CLINTON	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	N/A	-	-
566	CLINTON	It's a beautiful facility.	N/A	-	-
567	CLINTON	It immediately was put to use.	N/A	-	-
568	CLINTON	And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...	N/A	-	-
569	TRUMP	Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...	N/A	-	-
570	CLINTON	Well, to...	N/A	-	-
571	TRUMP	Which our country should do, too.	N/A	-	-
572	CLINTON	Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?	N/A	-	-
573	CLINTON	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	N/A	-	-
574	CLINTON	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	N/A	-	-
575	CLINTON	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	14	Donald Trump has filed for bankruptcy of his business six times.	TRUE
576	CLINTON	There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.	N/A	-	-
577	CLINTON	You call yourself the King of Debt.	N/A	-	-
578	CLINTON	You talk about leverage.	N/A	-	-
579	CLINTON	You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.	N/A	-	-
580	TRUMP	Wrong.	N/A	-	-
581	TRUMP	Wrong.	N/A	-	-
582	CLINTON	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	N/A	-	-
583	HOLT	Let's let Mr. Trump...	N/A	-	-
584	CLINTON	And we need to be very clear about that.	N/A	-	-
585	TRUMP	So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.	N/A	-	-
586	TRUMP	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	N/A	-	-
587	TRUMP	I built an unbelievable company.	N/A	-	-
588	TRUMP	Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.	N/A	-	-
589	TRUMP	It's an unbelievable company.	N/A	-	-
590	TRUMP	But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.	15	Donald Trump has filed for bankruptcy of his business four times.	FALSE
591	TRUMP	And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.	N/A	-	-
592	TRUMP	Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.	N/A	-	-
593	TRUMP	But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.	N/A	-	-
594	TRUMP	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	N/A	-	-
595	TRUMP	And that's what I do.	N/A	-	-
596	TRUMP	But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.	N/A	-	-
597	TRUMP	I'll give you an example.	N/A	-	-
598	TRUMP	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	N/A	-	-
599	TRUMP	But we're opening the Old Post Office.	N/A	-	-
600	TRUMP	Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.	N/A	-	-
601	TRUMP	I'm a year ahead of schedule.	N/A	-	-
602	TRUMP	And that's what this country should be doing.	N/A	-	-
603	TRUMP	We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.	N/A	-	-
604	TRUMP	We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.	N/A	-	-
605	TRUMP	When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.	N/A	-	-
606	TRUMP	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	N/A	-	-
607	TRUMP	And we should be able to do that for our country.	N/A	-	-
608	HOLT	Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.	N/A	-	-
609	HOLT	We move into our next segment talking about America's direction.	N/A	-	-
610	HOLT	And let's start by talking about race.	N/A	-	-
611	HOLT	The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.	N/A	-	-
612	HOLT	Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.	N/A	-	-
613	HOLT	So how do you heal the divide?	N/A	-	-
614	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.	N/A	-	-
615	CLINTON	Well, you're right.	N/A	-	-
616	CLINTON	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	N/A	-	-
617	CLINTON	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	N/A	-	-
618	CLINTON	We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.	N/A	-	-
619	CLINTON	And we've got to do several things at the same time.	N/A	-	-
620	CLINTON	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	N/A	-	-
621	CLINTON	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	N/A	-	-
622	CLINTON	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	N/A	-	-
623	CLINTON	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	N/A	-	-
624	CLINTON	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	N/A	-	-
625	CLINTON	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.	N/A	-	-
626	CLINTON	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	N/A	-	-
627	CLINTON	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	N/A	-	-
628	CLINTON	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	N/A	-	-
629	CLINTON	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	N/A	-	-
630	CLINTON	So we have to do two things, as I said.	N/A	-	-
631	CLINTON	We have to restore trust.	N/A	-	-
632	CLINTON	We have to work with the police.	N/A	-	-
633	CLINTON	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	N/A	-	-
634	CLINTON	And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.	N/A	-	-
635	HOLT	All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	N/A	-	-
636	HOLT	How do you heal the divide?	N/A	-	-
637	TRUMP	Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.	N/A	-	-
638	TRUMP	And we need law and order.	N/A	-	-
639	TRUMP	If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.	N/A	-	-
640	TRUMP	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	N/A	-	-
641	TRUMP	I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.	N/A	-	-
642	TRUMP	We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.	N/A	-	-
643	TRUMP	We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.	N/A	-	-
644	TRUMP	You walk down the street, you get shot.	N/A	-	-
645	TRUMP	In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.	N/A	-	-
646	TRUMP	Thousands of shootings.	N/A	-	-
647	TRUMP	And I'm saying, where is this?	N/A	-	-
648	TRUMP	Is this a war-torn country?	N/A	-	-
649	TRUMP	What are we doing?	N/A	-	-
650	TRUMP	And we have to stop the violence.	N/A	-	-
651	TRUMP	We have to bring back law and order.	N/A	-	-
652	TRUMP	In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.	16	Almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed since Barack Obama became president.	FALSE
653	TRUMP	We have to bring back law and order.	N/A	-	-
654	TRUMP	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	N/A	-	-
655	TRUMP	It brought the crime rate way down.	N/A	-	-
656	TRUMP	But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.	N/A	-	-
657	TRUMP	We have gangs roaming the street.	N/A	-	-
658	TRUMP	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	N/A	-	-
659	TRUMP	And they have guns.	N/A	-	-
660	TRUMP	And they shoot people.	N/A	-	-
661	TRUMP	And we have to be very strong.	N/A	-	-
662	TRUMP	And we have to be very vigilant.	N/A	-	-
663	TRUMP	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	N/A	-	-
664	TRUMP	Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.	N/A	-	-
665	TRUMP	We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.	N/A	-	-
666	HOLT	Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.	N/A	-	-
667	HOLT	Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.	17	Stop-and-frisk program was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.	TRUE
668	TRUMP	No, you're wrong.	N/A	-	-
669	TRUMP	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	N/A	-	-
670	TRUMP	It was taken away from her.	N/A	-	-
671	TRUMP	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	N/A	-	-
672	TRUMP	They would have won an appeal.	N/A	-	-
673	TRUMP	If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.	N/A	-	-
674	HOLT	The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.	N/A	-	-
675	TRUMP	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	N/A	-	-
676	TRUMP	These are felons.	N/A	-	-
677	TRUMP	These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.	N/A	-	-
678	TRUMP	You need more police.	N/A	-	-
679	TRUMP	You need a better community, you know, relation.	N/A	-	-
680	TRUMP	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	N/A	-	-
681	TRUMP	It's terrible.	N/A	-	-
682	TRUMP	I have property there.	N/A	-	-
683	TRUMP	It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.	N/A	-	-
684	TRUMP	But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.	N/A	-	-
685	TRUMP	You need better relationships.	N/A	-	-
686	TRUMP	I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.	N/A	-	-
687	TRUMP	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	N/A	-	-
688	TRUMP	But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.	N/A	-	-
689	TRUMP	So there's some bad things going on.	N/A	-	-
690	TRUMP	Some really bad things.	N/A	-	-
691	HOLT	Secretary Clinton...	N/A	-	-
692	TRUMP	But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.	N/A	-	-
693	TRUMP	And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.	N/A	-	-
694	TRUMP	And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.	N/A	-	-
695	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	N/A	-	-
696	CLINTON	Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.	N/A	-	-
697	TRUMP	Ugh.	N/A	-	-
698	CLINTON	You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.	N/A	-	-
699	CLINTON	There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.	N/A	-	-
700	CLINTON	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	N/A	-	-
701	CLINTON	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	N/A	-	-
702	CLINTON	Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.	18	Stop-and-frisk program was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.	HALF-TRUE
703	CLINTON	It did not do what it needed to do.	N/A	-	-
704	CLINTON	Now, I believe in community policing.	N/A	-	-
705	CLINTON	And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.	N/A	-	-
706	CLINTON	Property crime is down 40 percent.	N/A	-	-
707	CLINTON	We just don't want to see it creep back up.	N/A	-	-
708	CLINTON	We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.	N/A	-	-
709	CLINTON	But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.	N/A	-	-
710	CLINTON	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	N/A	-	-
711	CLINTON	And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.	N/A	-	-
712	CLINTON	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	N/A	-	-
713	CLINTON	We cannot just say law and order.	N/A	-	-
714	CLINTON	We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.	N/A	-	-
715	CLINTON	We need to have more second chance programs.	N/A	-	-
716	CLINTON	I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.	N/A	-	-
717	CLINTON	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.	N/A	-	-
718	CLINTON	So there are some positive ways we can work on this.	N/A	-	-
719	CLINTON	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	N/A	-	-
720	CLINTON	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	N/A	-	-
721	CLINTON	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	N/A	-	-
722	CLINTON	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	N/A	-	-
723	CLINTON	And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.	N/A	-	-
724	CLINTON	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	N/A	-	-
725	CLINTON	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	N/A	-	-
726	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.	N/A	-	-
727	HOLT	Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?	N/A	-	-
728	CLINTON	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	N/A	-	-
729	CLINTON	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	N/A	-	-
730	CLINTON	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	N/A	-	-
731	CLINTON	But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.	N/A	-	-
732	CLINTON	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	N/A	-	-
733	CLINTON	They admit it's an issue.	N/A	-	-
734	CLINTON	They've got a lot of concerns.	N/A	-	-
735	CLINTON	Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.	N/A	-	-
736	CLINTON	They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.	N/A	-	-
737	CLINTON	And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.	N/A	-	-
738	HOLT	Mr. Trump...	N/A	-	-
739	TRUMP	I'd like to respond to that.	N/A	-	-
740	HOLT	Please.	N/A	-	-
741	TRUMP	First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.	N/A	-	-
742	TRUMP	I agree with you.	N/A	-	-
743	TRUMP	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	N/A	-	-
744	TRUMP	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.	N/A	-	-
745	TRUMP	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	N/A	-	-
746	TRUMP	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	N/A	-	-
747	TRUMP	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.	N/A	-	-
748	TRUMP	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.	N/A	-	-
749	TRUMP	And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.	N/A	-	-
750	TRUMP	I think you've apologized for it.	N/A	-	-
751	TRUMP	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	N/A	-	-
752	TRUMP	And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.	N/A	-	-
753	TRUMP	Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.	N/A	-	-
754	TRUMP	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	N/A	-	-
755	TRUMP	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	N/A	-	-
756	TRUMP	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	N/A	-	-
757	TRUMP	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	N/A	-	-
758	TRUMP	But we went from 2,200 to 500.	N/A	-	-
759	TRUMP	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.	N/A	-	-
760	TRUMP	And it was terminated by current mayor.	N/A	-	-
761	TRUMP	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	N/A	-	-
762	TRUMP	Tremendous beyond belief.	N/A	-	-
763	TRUMP	So when you say it has no impact, it really did.	N/A	-	-
764	TRUMP	It had a very, very big impact.	N/A	-	-
765	CLINTON	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	19	Under Bill De Blasio, Democratic Mayor of New York City, crime, including murders, has continued to drop.	TRUE
766	CLINTON	So there is...	N/A	-	-
767	TRUMP	No, you're wrong.	N/A	-	-
768	TRUMP	You're wrong.	N/A	-	-
769	CLINTON	No, I'm not.	N/A	-	-
770	TRUMP	Murders are up.	20	Under Bill De Blasio, Democratic Mayor of New York City, murders went up.	TRUE
771	TRUMP	All right.	N/A	-	-
772	TRUMP	You check it.	N/A	-	-
773	CLINTON	New York -- New York has done an excellent job.	N/A	-	-
774	CLINTON	And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.	N/A	-	-
775	CLINTON	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	N/A	-	-
776	CLINTON	Look, one murder is too many.	N/A	-	-
777	CLINTON	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	N/A	-	-
778	CLINTON	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.	N/A	-	-
779	CLINTON	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	N/A	-	-
780	CLINTON	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	N/A	-	-
781	CLINTON	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	N/A	-	-
782	HOLT	This conversation is about race.	N/A	-	-
783	HOLT	And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...	N/A	-	-
784	TRUMP	I'd like to just respond, if I might.	N/A	-	-
785	HOLT	Please -- 20 seconds.	N/A	-	-
786	TRUMP	I'd just like to respond.	N/A	-	-
787	HOLT	Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.	N/A	-	-
788	TRUMP	I will.	N/A	-	-
789	TRUMP	Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.	N/A	-	-
790	TRUMP	They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.	N/A	-	-
791	TRUMP	The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.	N/A	-	-
792	TRUMP	They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.	N/A	-	-
793	TRUMP	They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.	N/A	-	-
794	HOLT	Mr. Trump, let me...	N/A	-	-
795	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
796	CLINTON	Well, I -- I do think...	N/A	-	-
797	TRUMP	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	N/A	-	-
798	TRUMP	You decided to stay home, and that's OK.	N/A	-	-
799	TRUMP	But I will tell you, I've been all over.	N/A	-	-
800	TRUMP	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	N/A	-	-
801	TRUMP	And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.	N/A	-	-
802	HOLT	Mr. Trump, I...	N/A	-	-
803	CLINTON	I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.	N/A	-	-
804	CLINTON	And, yes, I did.	N/A	-	-
805	CLINTON	And you know what else I prepared for?	N/A	-	-
806	CLINTON	I prepared to be president.	N/A	-	-
807	CLINTON	And I think that's a good thing.	N/A	-	-
808	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
809	HOLT	Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.	N/A	-	-
810	HOLT	You questioned his legitimacy.	N/A	-	-
811	HOLT	In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States.	N/A	-	-
812	HOLT	Can you tell us what took you so long?	N/A	-	-
813	TRUMP	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	N/A	-	-
814	TRUMP	Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.	N/A	-	-
815	TRUMP	And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.	N/A	-	-
816	TRUMP	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	N/A	-	-
817	TRUMP	And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.	21	Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton's 2008 campaign manager, said on CNN with Wolf Blitzer that Sidney Blumenthal, a senior advisor of Clinton, sent McClatchy, a highly respected reporter, to Kenya to investigate Obama's birthplace.	FALSE
818	TRUMP	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	22	Sidney Blumenthal, a senior advisor of Clinton, sent a reporter to Kenya to find out about Obama's birthplace.	FALSE
819	TRUMP	They were pressing it very hard.	N/A	-	-
820	TRUMP	She failed to get the birth certificate.	N/A	-	-
821	TRUMP	When I got involved, I didn't fail.	N/A	-	-
822	TRUMP	I got him to give the birth certificate.	N/A	-	-
823	TRUMP	So I'm satisfied with it.	N/A	-	-
824	TRUMP	And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.	N/A	-	-
825	HOLT	That was...	N/A	-	-
826	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
827	TRUMP	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	N/A	-	-
828	HOLT	I will let you respond.	N/A	-	-
829	HOLT	It's important.	N/A	-	-
830	HOLT	But I just want to get the answer here.	N/A	-	-
831	HOLT	The birth certificate was produced in 2011.	N/A	-	-
832	HOLT	You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...	N/A	-	-
833	TRUMP	Yeah.	N/A	-	-
834	HOLT	as recently as January.	N/A	-	-
835	HOLT	So the question is, what changed your mind?	N/A	-	-
836	TRUMP	Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.	N/A	-	-
837	TRUMP	I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.	N/A	-	-
838	TRUMP	But nobody was caring much about it.	N/A	-	-
839	TRUMP	But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.	N/A	-	-
840	TRUMP	And I think I did a good job.	N/A	-	-
841	TRUMP	Secretary Clinton also fought it.	N/A	-	-
842	TRUMP	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	N/A	-	-
843	TRUMP	Look, it's true.	N/A	-	-
844	TRUMP	Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.	22	Sidney Blumenthal, a senior advisor of Clinton, sent a reporter to Kenya to find out about Obama's birthplace.	FALSE
845	TRUMP	And she was involved.	N/A	-	-
846	TRUMP	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	N/A	-	-
847	HOLT	I'm sorry.	N/A	-	-
848	HOLT	I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.	N/A	-	-
849	HOLT	But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.	N/A	-	-
850	HOLT	What do you say to Americans, people of color who...	N/A	-	-
851	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
852	TRUMP	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	N/A	-	-
853	TRUMP	I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.	N/A	-	-
854	TRUMP	He should have produced it a long time before.	N/A	-	-
855	TRUMP	I say nothing.	N/A	-	-
856	TRUMP	But let me just tell you.	N/A	-	-
857	TRUMP	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	N/A	-	-
858	TRUMP	I think you can see that.	N/A	-	-
859	TRUMP	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	N/A	-	-
860	TRUMP	And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.	N/A	-	-
861	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	N/A	-	-
862	CLINTON	Well, just listen to what you heard.	N/A	-	-
863	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	N/A	-	-
864	CLINTON	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	N/A	-	-
865	CLINTON	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	N/A	-	-
866	CLINTON	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	N/A	-	-
867	CLINTON	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	N/A	-	-
868	CLINTON	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	N/A	-	-
869	CLINTON	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.	N/A	-	-
870	CLINTON	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	N/A	-	-
871	CLINTON	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	N/A	-	-
872	CLINTON	You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.	N/A	-	-
873	CLINTON	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	N/A	-	-
874	CLINTON	But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.	N/A	-	-
875	CLINTON	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.	N/A	-	-
876	HOLT	Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.	N/A	-	-
877	TRUMP	I would love to respond.	N/A	-	-
878	TRUMP	First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.	N/A	-	-
879	TRUMP	You treated him with terrible disrespect.	N/A	-	-
880	TRUMP	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	N/A	-	-
881	TRUMP	It doesn't work that way.	N/A	-	-
882	TRUMP	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	N/A	-	-
883	TRUMP	I don't think you can deny that.	N/A	-	-
884	TRUMP	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	N/A	-	-
885	TRUMP	So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.	N/A	-	-
886	TRUMP	It really doesn't.	N/A	-	-
887	TRUMP	Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.	N/A	-	-
888	TRUMP	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.	N/A	-	-
889	TRUMP	It was very easy to do.	N/A	-	-
890	TRUMP	I notice you bring that up a lot.	N/A	-	-
891	TRUMP	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	N/A	-	-
892	TRUMP	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	N/A	-	-
893	TRUMP	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	N/A	-	-
894	TRUMP	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	N/A	-	-
895	TRUMP	I'll go one step further.	N/A	-	-
896	TRUMP	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	N/A	-	-
897	TRUMP	No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.	N/A	-	-
898	TRUMP	And it's a tremendously successful club.	N/A	-	-
899	TRUMP	And I'm so glad I did it.	N/A	-	-
900	TRUMP	And I have been given great credit for what I did.	N/A	-	-
901	TRUMP	And I'm very, very proud of it.	N/A	-	-
902	TRUMP	And that's the way I feel.	N/A	-	-
903	TRUMP	That is the true way I feel.	N/A	-	-
904	HOLT	Our next segment is called "Securing America."	N/A	-	-
905	HOLT	We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.	N/A	-	-
906	HOLT	Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.	N/A	-	-
907	HOLT	So my question is, who's behind it?	N/A	-	-
908	HOLT	And how do we fight it?	N/A	-	-
909	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.	N/A	-	-
910	CLINTON	Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.	N/A	-	-
911	CLINTON	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.	N/A	-	-
912	CLINTON	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	N/A	-	-
913	CLINTON	The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.	N/A	-	-
914	CLINTON	There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.	N/A	-	-
915	CLINTON	I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...	N/A	-	-
916	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	N/A	-	-
917	CLINTON	tough, long game here.	N/A	-	-
918	CLINTON	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	N/A	-	-
919	CLINTON	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	N/A	-	-
920	CLINTON	We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.	N/A	-	-
921	CLINTON	And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.	N/A	-	-
922	CLINTON	And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.	N/A	-	-
923	CLINTON	We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.	N/A	-	-
924	CLINTON	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	N/A	-	-
925	CLINTON	And the Russians need to understand that.	N/A	-	-
926	CLINTON	I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.	N/A	-	-
927	CLINTON	And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.	N/A	-	-
928	CLINTON	That is just unacceptable.	N/A	-	-
929	CLINTON	It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...	N/A	-	-
930	HOLT	Your two minutes have expired.	N/A	-	-
931	CLINTON	have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.	N/A	-	-
932	CLINTON	It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.	N/A	-	-
933	HOLT	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question.	N/A	-	-
934	HOLT	Who's behind it?	N/A	-	-
935	HOLT	And how do we fight it?	N/A	-	-
936	TRUMP	I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.	N/A	-	-
937	TRUMP	That just happened, and many more are coming.	N/A	-	-
938	TRUMP	And I'm very proud of it.	N/A	-	-
939	TRUMP	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	N/A	-	-
940	TRUMP	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	N/A	-	-
941	TRUMP	I was just endorsed by ICE.	N/A	-	-
942	TRUMP	I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.	N/A	-	-
943	TRUMP	So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.	N/A	-	-
944	TRUMP	OK?	N/A	-	-
945	TRUMP	Because look at the mess that we're in.	N/A	-	-
946	TRUMP	Look at the mess that we're in.	N/A	-	-
947	TRUMP	As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.	N/A	-	-
948	TRUMP	We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.	N/A	-	-
949	TRUMP	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	N/A	-	-
950	TRUMP	She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.	N/A	-	-
951	TRUMP	I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.	N/A	-	-
952	TRUMP	It could also be lots of other people.	N/A	-	-
953	TRUMP	It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?	N/A	-	-
954	TRUMP	You don't know who broke in to DNC.	N/A	-	-
955	TRUMP	But what did we learn with DNC?	N/A	-	-
956	TRUMP	We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.	N/A	-	-
957	TRUMP	Look what happened to her.	N/A	-	-
958	TRUMP	But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.	N/A	-	-
959	TRUMP	That's what we learned.	N/A	-	-
960	TRUMP	Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.	N/A	-	-
961	TRUMP	We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.	N/A	-	-
962	TRUMP	ISIS.	N/A	-	-
963	TRUMP	So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.	N/A	-	-
964	TRUMP	It is -- it is a huge problem.	N/A	-	-
965	TRUMP	I have a son.	N/A	-	-
966	TRUMP	He's 10 years old.	N/A	-	-
967	TRUMP	He has computers.	N/A	-	-
968	TRUMP	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	N/A	-	-
969	TRUMP	The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	N/A	-	-
970	TRUMP	And maybe it's hardly doable.	N/A	-	-
971	TRUMP	But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.	N/A	-	-
972	TRUMP	But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.	N/A	-	-
973	TRUMP	We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.	N/A	-	-
974	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	N/A	-	-
975	CLINTON	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	N/A	-	-
976	CLINTON	I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.	N/A	-	-
977	CLINTON	It does involve going after them online.	N/A	-	-
978	CLINTON	I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.	N/A	-	-
979	CLINTON	But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.	N/A	-	-
980	CLINTON	We're making progress.	N/A	-	-
981	CLINTON	Our military is assisting in Iraq.	N/A	-	-
982	CLINTON	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	N/A	-	-
983	CLINTON	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	N/A	-	-
984	CLINTON	And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.	N/A	-	-
985	CLINTON	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	N/A	-	-
986	CLINTON	And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.	N/A	-	-
987	CLINTON	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	N/A	-	-
988	HOLT	You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.	N/A	-	-
989	HOLT	I'll ask this to both of you.	N/A	-	-
990	HOLT	Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?	N/A	-	-
991	TRUMP	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	N/A	-	-
992	TRUMP	Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.	N/A	-	-
993	TRUMP	We will take out ISIS.	N/A	-	-
994	TRUMP	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.	N/A	-	-
995	TRUMP	And ISIS was formed.	N/A	-	-
996	TRUMP	So she talks about taking them out.	N/A	-	-
997	TRUMP	She's been doing it a long time.	N/A	-	-
998	TRUMP	She's been trying to take them out for a long time.	N/A	-	-
999	TRUMP	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	N/A	-	-
1000	TRUMP	And then you wouldn't have had them.	N/A	-	-
1001	TRUMP	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.	N/A	-	-
1002	TRUMP	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	23	The Islamic State is producing and selling oil out of Lybia.	FALSE
1003	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	N/A	-	-
1004	CLINTON	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	N/A	-	-
1005	CLINTON	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	N/A	-	-
1006	TRUMP	Wrong.	N/A	-	-
1007	CLINTON	That is absolutely proved over and over again.	N/A	-	-
1008	TRUMP	Wrong.	N/A	-	-
1009	TRUMP	Wrong.	N/A	-	-
1010	CLINTON	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	N/A	-	-
1011	CLINTON	But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.	N/A	-	-
1012	CLINTON	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	N/A	-	-
1013	CLINTON	But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.	N/A	-	-
1014	CLINTON	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	N/A	-	-
1015	CLINTON	That's the most important part of this.	N/A	-	-
1016	CLINTON	How do we prevent attacks?	N/A	-	-
1017	CLINTON	How do we protect our people?	N/A	-	-
1018	CLINTON	And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.	N/A	-	-
1019	CLINTON	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	N/A	-	-
1020	CLINTON	You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.	N/A	-	-
1021	CLINTON	And they brought him down.	N/A	-	-
1022	CLINTON	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	N/A	-	-
1023	CLINTON	So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.	N/A	-	-
1024	CLINTON	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	N/A	-	-
1025	CLINTON	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	N/A	-	-
1026	CLINTON	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	N/A	-	-
1027	CLINTON	Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.	N/A	-	-
1028	CLINTON	They're on the front lines.	N/A	-	-
1029	CLINTON	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	N/A	-	-
1030	CLINTON	They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.	N/A	-	-
1031	HOLT	Mr. Trump...	N/A	-	-
1032	TRUMP	Well, I have to respond.	N/A	-	-
1033	HOLT	Please respond.	N/A	-	-
1034	TRUMP	The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.	N/A	-	-
1035	TRUMP	You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.	N/A	-	-
1036	TRUMP	Under your direction, to a large extent.	N/A	-	-
1037	TRUMP	But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.	N/A	-	-
1038	TRUMP	They were choking on the sanctions.	N/A	-	-
1039	TRUMP	And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.	N/A	-	-
1040	TRUMP	But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?	N/A	-	-
1041	TRUMP	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	N/A	-	-
1042	TRUMP	I did really well.	N/A	-	-
1043	TRUMP	But I have common sense.	N/A	-	-
1044	TRUMP	And I said, well, I'll tell you.	N/A	-	-
1045	TRUMP	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.	N/A	-	-
1046	TRUMP	But two things.	N/A	-	-
1047	TRUMP	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	N/A	-	-
1048	TRUMP	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	N/A	-	-
1049	TRUMP	And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.	N/A	-	-
1050	TRUMP	And I was very strong.	N/A	-	-
1051	TRUMP	And I said it numerous times.	N/A	-	-
1052	TRUMP	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	N/A	-	-
1053	TRUMP	And I think that's great.	N/A	-	-
1054	TRUMP	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	N/A	-	-
1055	TRUMP	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	N/A	-	-
1056	TRUMP	But I'm all for NATO.	N/A	-	-
1057	TRUMP	But I said they have to focus on terror, also.	N/A	-	-
1058	TRUMP	And they're going to do that.	N/A	-	-
1059	TRUMP	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	N/A	-	-
1060	TRUMP	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	24	ISIS formed in the vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	HALF-TRUE
1061	TRUMP	And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.	25	Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton took out the US troops from Iraq.	TRUE
1062	TRUMP	Not only that, you named the day.	26	Barack Obama's administration set the final date to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq.	FALSE
1063	TRUMP	They couldn't believe it.	N/A	-	-
1064	TRUMP	They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.	N/A	-	-
1065	TRUMP	They said...	N/A	-	-
1066	CLINTON	Lester, we've covered...	N/A	-	-
1067	TRUMP	No, wait a minute.	N/A	-	-
1068	CLINTON	We've covered this ground.	N/A	-	-
1069	TRUMP	When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.	N/A	-	-
1070	TRUMP	It should have never happened.	N/A	-	-
1071	TRUMP	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	N/A	-	-
1072	TRUMP	But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.	N/A	-	-
1073	TRUMP	Now it's in over 30 countries.	N/A	-	-
1074	TRUMP	And you're going to stop them?	N/A	-	-
1075	TRUMP	I don't think so.	N/A	-	-
1076	HOLT	Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.	N/A	-	-
1077	HOLT	You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.	N/A	-	-
1078	HOLT	What makes your...	N/A	-	-
1079	TRUMP	I did not support the war in Iraq.	N/A	-	-
1080	HOLT	In 2002...	N/A	-	-
1081	TRUMP	That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.	N/A	-	-
1082	HOLT	My question is, since you supported it...	N/A	-	-
1083	TRUMP	Just -- would you like to hear...	N/A	-	-
1084	HOLT	why is your -- why is your judgment...	N/A	-	-
1085	TRUMP	Wait a minute.	N/A	-	-
1086	TRUMP	I was against the war in Iraq.	27	Donald Trump was openly against the war in Iraq before it had started.	FALSE
1087	TRUMP	Just so you put it out.	N/A	-	-
1088	HOLT	The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...	N/A	-	-
1089	TRUMP	The record does not show that.	N/A	-	-
1090	HOLT	Why was -- is your judgment any...	N/A	-	-
1091	TRUMP	The record shows that I'm right.	N/A	-	-
1092	TRUMP	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	N/A	-	-
1093	TRUMP	Essentially.	N/A	-	-
1094	TRUMP	I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.	N/A	-	-
1095	TRUMP	We talked about the economy is more important.	N/A	-	-
1096	TRUMP	I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.	N/A	-	-
1097	TRUMP	I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.	N/A	-	-
1098	TRUMP	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	27	Donald Trump was openly against the war in Iraq before it had started.	FALSE
1099	HOLT	Why is your judgment better than...	N/A	-	-
1100	TRUMP	And when he -- excuse me.	N/A	-	-
1101	TRUMP	And that was before the war started.	N/A	-	-
1102	TRUMP	Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.	N/A	-	-
1103	TRUMP	I was against the war.	27	Donald Trump was openly against the war in Iraq before it had started.	FALSE
1104	TRUMP	He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.	N/A	-	-
1105	TRUMP	And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.	N/A	-	-
1106	TRUMP	But nobody called Sean Hannity.	N/A	-	-
1107	TRUMP	And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.	N/A	-	-
1108	TRUMP	I think in '04.	N/A	-	-
1109	TRUMP	But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.	N/A	-	-
1110	TRUMP	And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.	N/A	-	-
1111	TRUMP	But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.	N/A	-	-
1112	TRUMP	He and I used to have arguments about the war.	N/A	-	-
1113	TRUMP	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	N/A	-	-
1114	TRUMP	It's going to destabilize the Middle East.	N/A	-	-
1115	TRUMP	And that's exactly what it's done.	N/A	-	-
1116	TRUMP	It's been a disaster.	N/A	-	-
1117	HOLT	My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...	N/A	-	-
1118	TRUMP	No, no.	N/A	-	-
1119	TRUMP	You didn't hear what I said.	N/A	-	-
1120	HOLT	Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?	N/A	-	-
1121	TRUMP	Well, I have much better judgment than she does.	N/A	-	-
1122	TRUMP	There's no question about that.	N/A	-	-
1123	TRUMP	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	N/A	-	-
1124	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	N/A	-	-
1125	TRUMP	I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.	N/A	-	-
1126	TRUMP	I have a winning temperament.	N/A	-	-
1127	TRUMP	I know how to win.	N/A	-	-
1128	TRUMP	She does not have a...	N/A	-	-
1129	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	N/A	-	-
1130	TRUMP	Wait.	N/A	-	-
1131	TRUMP	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	N/A	-	-
1132	TRUMP	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	N/A	-	-
1133	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	N/A	-	-
1134	CLINTON	Whew, OK.	N/A	-	-
1135	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	N/A	-	-
1136	CLINTON	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	N/A	-	-
1137	CLINTON	You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.	N/A	-	-
1138	CLINTON	And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?	N/A	-	-
1139	CLINTON	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	N/A	-	-
1140	CLINTON	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	N/A	-	-
1141	CLINTON	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	N/A	-	-
1142	CLINTON	They had built covert facilities.	N/A	-	-
1143	CLINTON	They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.	N/A	-	-
1144	CLINTON	And we had sanctioned them.	N/A	-	-
1145	CLINTON	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	N/A	-	-
1146	CLINTON	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.	N/A	-	-
1147	CLINTON	And we did drive them to the negotiating table.	N/A	-	-
1148	CLINTON	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	N/A	-	-
1149	CLINTON	That's diplomacy.	N/A	-	-
1150	CLINTON	That's coalition-building.	N/A	-	-
1151	CLINTON	That's working with other nations.	N/A	-	-
1152	CLINTON	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	N/A	-	-
1153	CLINTON	He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.	N/A	-	-
1154	CLINTON	That's not good judgment.	N/A	-	-
1155	TRUMP	That would not start a war.	N/A	-	-
1156	CLINTON	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	N/A	-	-
1157	CLINTON	And the worst part...	N/A	-	-
1158	TRUMP	No, they were taunting us.	N/A	-	-
1159	CLINTON	of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.	N/A	-	-
1160	CLINTON	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	N/A	-	-
1161	CLINTON	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	N/A	-	-
1162	CLINTON	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	N/A	-	-
1163	TRUMP	Wrong.	N/A	-	-
1164	CLINTON	have a good time, folks.	N/A	-	-
1165	TRUMP	It's lies.	N/A	-	-
1166	CLINTON	And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.	N/A	-	-
1167	CLINTON	That is the number-one threat we face in the world.	N/A	-	-
1168	CLINTON	And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.	N/A	-	-
1169	CLINTON	So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.	N/A	-	-
1170	TRUMP	That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.	N/A	-	-
1171	TRUMP	I would like to...	N/A	-	-
1172	CLINTON	It's a good one, though.	N/A	-	-
1173	CLINTON	It well describes the problem.	N/A	-	-
1174	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	N/A	-	-
1175	TRUMP	It's not an accurate one at all.	N/A	-	-
1176	TRUMP	It's not an accurate one.	N/A	-	-
1177	TRUMP	So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.	N/A	-	-
1178	TRUMP	I agree with her on one thing.	N/A	-	-
1179	TRUMP	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	N/A	-	-
1180	TRUMP	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	N/A	-	-
1181	TRUMP	Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.	N/A	-	-
1182	TRUMP	They do not pay us.	N/A	-	-
1183	TRUMP	But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.	N/A	-	-
1184	TRUMP	That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.	N/A	-	-
1185	TRUMP	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	N/A	-	-
1186	TRUMP	All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.	N/A	-	-
1187	TRUMP	We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...	N/A	-	-
1188	HOLT	We need to move on.	N/A	-	-
1189	TRUMP	Well, wait, but it's very important.	N/A	-	-
1190	TRUMP	All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.	N/A	-	-
1191	TRUMP	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	N/A	-	-
1192	TRUMP	They have to help us out.	N/A	-	-
1193	HOLT	Our last...	N/A	-	-
1194	TRUMP	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	N/A	-	-
1195	TRUMP	It is the single greatest threat that this country has.	N/A	-	-
1196	HOLT	Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.	N/A	-	-
1197	HOLT	On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.	N/A	-	-
1198	HOLT	Do you support the current policy?	N/A	-	-
1199	HOLT	Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.	N/A	-	-
1200	TRUMP	Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.	N/A	-	-
1201	TRUMP	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.	N/A	-	-
1202	TRUMP	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	N/A	-	-
1203	TRUMP	I looked the other night.	N/A	-	-
1204	TRUMP	I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.	N/A	-	-
1205	TRUMP	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	N/A	-	-
1206	TRUMP	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	N/A	-	-
1207	TRUMP	But I would certainly not do first strike.	N/A	-	-
1208	TRUMP	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	N/A	-	-
1209	TRUMP	At the same time, we have to be prepared.	N/A	-	-
1210	TRUMP	I can't take anything off the table.	N/A	-	-
1211	TRUMP	Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.	N/A	-	-
1212	TRUMP	China should solve that problem for us.	N/A	-	-
1213	TRUMP	China should go into North Korea.	N/A	-	-
1214	TRUMP	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.	N/A	-	-
1215	TRUMP	And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.	N/A	-	-
1216	TRUMP	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.	N/A	-	-
1217	TRUMP	Iran has power over North Korea.	N/A	-	-
1218	TRUMP	And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.	N/A	-	-
1219	TRUMP	And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.	N/A	-	-
1220	TRUMP	And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?	N/A	-	-
1221	TRUMP	Why didn't you add other things into the deal?	N/A	-	-
1222	TRUMP	One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.	28	The Obama administration paid to Iran $400 million in cash.	FALSE
1223	TRUMP	Nobody's ever seen that before.	N/A	-	-
1224	TRUMP	That turned out to be wrong.	N/A	-	-
1225	TRUMP	It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.	29	The Obama administration paid to Iran $1.7 billion in cash for hostages.	HALF-TRUE
1226	TRUMP	It certainly looks that way.	N/A	-	-
1227	TRUMP	So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?	N/A	-	-
1228	TRUMP	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	N/A	-	-
1229	TRUMP	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.	N/A	-	-
1230	TRUMP	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	N/A	-	-
1231	HOLT	Your two minutes is expired.	N/A	-	-
1232	TRUMP	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	N/A	-	-
1233	TRUMP	I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.	N/A	-	-
1234	TRUMP	Believe me, he's not a happy camper.	N/A	-	-
1235	HOLT	All right.	N/A	-	-
1236	HOLT	Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	N/A	-	-
1237	CLINTON	Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.	N/A	-	-
1238	CLINTON	Words matter when you run for president.	N/A	-	-
1239	CLINTON	And they really matter when you are president.	N/A	-	-
1240	CLINTON	And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.	N/A	-	-
1241	CLINTON	It is essential that America's word be good.	N/A	-	-
1242	CLINTON	And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.	N/A	-	-
1243	CLINTON	I've talked with a number of them.	N/A	-	-
1244	CLINTON	But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.	N/A	-	-
1245	CLINTON	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	N/A	-	-
1246	CLINTON	There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.	N/A	-	-
1247	CLINTON	But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.	N/A	-	-
1248	CLINTON	And Donald never tells you what he would do.	N/A	-	-
1249	CLINTON	Would he have started a war?	N/A	-	-
1250	CLINTON	Would he have bombed Iran?	N/A	-	-
1251	CLINTON	If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.	N/A	-	-
1252	CLINTON	But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.	N/A	-	-
1253	CLINTON	He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.	N/A	-	-
1254	CLINTON	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	N/A	-	-
1255	CLINTON	People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.	N/A	-	-
1256	CLINTON	Can they rely on us?	N/A	-	-
1257	CLINTON	Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?	N/A	-	-
1258	CLINTON	That's what I intend to do.	N/A	-	-
1259	CLINTON	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	N/A	-	-
1260	CLINTON	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	N/A	-	-
1261	HOLT	Your two minutes is...	N/A	-	-
1262	CLINTON	to be given any opportunities at all.	N/A	-	-
1263	HOLT	is expired.	N/A	-	-
1264	TRUMP	Lester, one thing I'd like to say.	N/A	-	-
1265	HOLT	Very quickly.	N/A	-	-
1266	HOLT	Twenty seconds.	N/A	-	-
1267	TRUMP	I will go very quickly.	N/A	-	-
1268	TRUMP	But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.	N/A	-	-
1269	TRUMP	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	N/A	-	-
1270	HOLT	Mr. Trump...	N/A	-	-
1271	TRUMP	And it's a big problem.	N/A	-	-
1272	TRUMP	And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.	N/A	-	-
1273	TRUMP	We cannot be the policemen of the world.	N/A	-	-
1274	TRUMP	We cannot protect countries all over the world...	N/A	-	-
1275	HOLT	We have just...	N/A	-	-
1276	TRUMP	where they're not paying us what we need.	N/A	-	-
1277	HOLT	We have just a few final questions...	N/A	-	-
1278	TRUMP	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	N/A	-	-
1279	TRUMP	We need heart.	N/A	-	-
1280	TRUMP	We need a lot of things.	N/A	-	-
1281	TRUMP	But you have to have some basic ability.	N/A	-	-
1282	TRUMP	And sadly, she doesn't have that.	N/A	-	-
1283	TRUMP	All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.	N/A	-	-
1284	TRUMP	But they weren't taken care of.	N/A	-	-
1285	TRUMP	And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.	N/A	-	-
1286	HOLT	Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.	N/A	-	-
1287	HOLT	Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, "a presidential look."	N/A	-	-
1288	HOLT	She's standing here right now.	N/A	-	-
1289	HOLT	What did you mean by that?	N/A	-	-
1290	TRUMP	She doesn't have the look.	N/A	-	-
1291	TRUMP	She doesn't have the stamina.	N/A	-	-
1292	TRUMP	I said she doesn't have the stamina.	N/A	-	-
1293	TRUMP	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	N/A	-	-
1294	TRUMP	To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.	N/A	-	-
1295	HOLT	The quote was, "I just don't think she has the presidential look."	N/A	-	-
1296	TRUMP	You have -- wait a minute.	N/A	-	-
1297	TRUMP	Wait a minute, Lester.	N/A	-	-
1298	TRUMP	You asked me a question.	N/A	-	-
1299	TRUMP	Did you ask me a question?	N/A	-	-
1300	TRUMP	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	N/A	-	-
1301	TRUMP	You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.	N/A	-	-
1302	TRUMP	I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?	N/A	-	-
1303	TRUMP	And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?	N/A	-	-
1304	TRUMP	All you have to do is speak to them.	N/A	-	-
1305	TRUMP	Wait.	N/A	-	-
1306	TRUMP	You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.	N/A	-	-
1307	HOLT	Let's let her respond.	N/A	-	-
1308	CLINTON	Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.	N/A	-	-
1309	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
1310	TRUMP	The world -- let me tell you.	N/A	-	-
1311	TRUMP	Let me tell you.	N/A	-	-
1312	TRUMP	Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.	N/A	-	-
1313	TRUMP	We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.	N/A	-	-
1314	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
1315	TRUMP	But it's bad, bad experience.	N/A	-	-
1316	TRUMP	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	N/A	-	-
1317	TRUMP	I agree.	N/A	-	-
1318	TRUMP	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	N/A	-	-
1319	TRUMP	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	N/A	-	-
1320	HOLT	We are at -- we are at the final question.	N/A	-	-
1321	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
1322	CLINTON	Well, one thing.	N/A	-	-
1323	CLINTON	One thing, Lester.	N/A	-	-
1324	HOLT	Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.	N/A	-	-
1325	CLINTON	You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.	N/A	-	-
1326	CLINTON	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...	N/A	-	-
1327	TRUMP	I never said that.	N/A	-	-
1328	CLINTON	women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	30	Donald Trump said that women do not deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	FALSE
1329	TRUMP	I didn't say that.	N/A	-	-
1330	CLINTON	And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.	N/A	-	-
1331	CLINTON	He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.	N/A	-	-
1332	CLINTON	And he called this woman "Miss Piggy."	N/A	-	-
1333	CLINTON	Then he called her "Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina.	N/A	-	-
1334	CLINTON	Donald, she has a name.	N/A	-	-
1335	TRUMP	Where did you find this?	N/A	-	-
1336	TRUMP	Where did you find this?	N/A	-	-
1337	CLINTON	Her name is Alicia Machado.	N/A	-	-
1338	TRUMP	Where did you find this?	N/A	-	-
1339	CLINTON	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	N/A	-	-
1340	TRUMP	Oh, really?	N/A	-	-
1341	CLINTON	she's going to vote this November.	N/A	-	-
1342	TRUMP	OK, good.	N/A	-	-
1343	TRUMP	Let me just tell you...	N/A	-	-
1344	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
1345	HOLT	Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...	N/A	-	-
1346	TRUMP	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	N/A	-	-
1347	TRUMP	Some of it's said in entertainment.	N/A	-	-
1348	TRUMP	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	N/A	-	-
1349	TRUMP	But you want to know the truth?	N/A	-	-
1350	TRUMP	I was going to say something...	N/A	-	-
1351	HOLT	Please very quickly.	N/A	-	-
1352	TRUMP	... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it.	N/A	-	-
1353	TRUMP	I just can't do it.	N/A	-	-
1354	TRUMP	It's inappropriate.	N/A	-	-
1355	TRUMP	It's not nice."	N/A	-	-
1356	TRUMP	But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.	N/A	-	-
1357	TRUMP	They're untrue.	N/A	-	-
1358	TRUMP	And they're misrepresentations.	N/A	-	-
1359	TRUMP	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	N/A	-	-
1360	TRUMP	And I don't deserve that.	N/A	-	-
1361	TRUMP	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	N/A	-	-
1362	TRUMP	It's hundreds of millions of ads.	N/A	-	-
1363	TRUMP	And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...	N/A	-	-
1364	HOLT	We have to move on to the final question.	N/A	-	-
1365	TRUMP	$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.	N/A	-	-
1366	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
1367	HOLT	One of you will not win this election.	N/A	-	-
1368	HOLT	So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?	N/A	-	-
1369	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?	N/A	-	-
1370	CLINTON	Well, I support our democracy.	N/A	-	-
1371	CLINTON	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	N/A	-	-
1372	CLINTON	But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.	N/A	-	-
1373	CLINTON	And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.	N/A	-	-
1374	CLINTON	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.	N/A	-	-
1375	CLINTON	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	N/A	-	-
1376	HOLT	Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question.	N/A	-	-
1377	HOLT	Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?	N/A	-	-
1378	TRUMP	I want to make America great again.	N/A	-	-
1379	TRUMP	We are a nation that is seriously troubled.	N/A	-	-
1380	TRUMP	We're losing our jobs.	N/A	-	-
1381	TRUMP	People are pouring into our country.	N/A	-	-
1382	TRUMP	The other day, we were deporting 800 people.	N/A	-	-
1383	TRUMP	And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.	N/A	-	-
1384	TRUMP	Ended up becoming citizens.	N/A	-	-
1385	TRUMP	And it was 800.	N/A	-	-
1386	TRUMP	And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.	N/A	-	-
1387	HOLT	Will you accept the outcome of the election?	N/A	-	-
1388	TRUMP	Look, here's the story.	N/A	-	-
1389	TRUMP	I want to make America great again.	N/A	-	-
1390	TRUMP	I'm going to be able to do it.	N/A	-	-
1391	TRUMP	I don't believe Hillary will.	N/A	-	-
1392	TRUMP	The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.	N/A	-	-
1393	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	N/A	-	-
1394	HOLT	All right.	N/A	-	-
1395	HOLT	Well, that is going to do it for us.	N/A	-	-
1396	HOLT	That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one.	N/A	-	-
1397	HOLT	We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.	N/A	-	-
1398	HOLT	The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.	N/A	-	-
1399	HOLT	The conversation will continue.	N/A	-	-
1400	HOLT	A reminder.	N/A	-	-
1401	HOLT	The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.	N/A	-	-
1402	HOLT	My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight.	N/A	-	-
1403	HOLT	Good night, everyone.	N/A	-	-
